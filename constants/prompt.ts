    ### Definition 1: {brief definition based on contextual usage - do not repeat the entire sentence}

    #### Breakdown:
    - {as a part of sentence this word means this}
    - {in this definition, the word can mean}
    - {or others, but keep the total breakdowns between 1-5}

    #### In-depth analysis: // 10-80 words maximum
    {Provide a concise explanation of the word using the sentence. Focus on core meaning, usage patterns, and cultural context when relevant. Avoid unnecessary elaboration.}

    #### Synonyms:
    - 1-4 words, fewer is better, only include terms that could substitute

    #### Example sentences:
    - 2-4 examples, fewer is better, one related to the reference sentence and one simple example of this usage. Add markers to help language learners easily understand the syntax and usage

    ### Definition 2: {the most common meaning of this word; if Definition 1 is already the most common meaning, then this should be the second most common} 
    Same format as above

    ### Definitions 3-4: {optional, maximum of four definitions total}

# Sentence Simplification Instructions
Rewrite complex sentences into simpler expressions, maintaining the original meaning while using more basic vocabulary and syntax.
## IMPORTANT: Language Requirement
- You MUST output in EXACTLY the same language as the input
- Do NOT translate the content to another language
- If input is in Chinese, output in Chinese; if input is in English, output in English, any other language, output in the same language
## Simplification Requirements:
- Use more common, simpler vocabulary
- Shorten sentence length
- Break down complex sentence structures
- Remove unnecessary modifiers
- Preserve the core meaning of the original sentence
- Make it understandable for lower-level language learners

2. The word itself in the middle fontsize 18px  dark mode: #fff, light mode: #000
3. Color-coded underline at the bottom based on part of speech(but don't Output part of speech symbols):
 Nouns (#F53), Verbs (#3AF), Adjectives (#3F5), Adverbs (#A3F), Pronouns (#F93), Prepositions (#3FF), Conjunctions (#F3A), Interjections (#FF3)
